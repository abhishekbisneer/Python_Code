#Write To A File 
#Exercise 21 (and Solution)
'''
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise 
(if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code, 
use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, 
write the results to a txt file. In your code, 
just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:
Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
