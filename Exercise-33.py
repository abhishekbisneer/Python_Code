#Birthday Dictionaries 
#Exercise 33 (and Solution)
'''
This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. 
The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, 
and be able to find that information based on their name. 
Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. 
When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
